### About
I am a NLP Scientist at CodaMetrix. My work focuses on develpoing machine/deep learning architecures to model Electronic Health Records (EHR), compiling novel large EHR corpora, and ultimately building an automation system for medical billing. Before joining CodaMetrix, I received my MS degree in Computational Linguistics from Brandeis University. 

My research interests include Natural Language Understanding, Clinical NLP, Language Annotation and ML/DL in general.

<!-- ## Activities
---
### Designing Multimodal Datasets for NLP Challenges
I am working on building R2VQ, a dataset designed for testing competence-based comprehension of machines over a multimodal recipe collection.
Check out [here](https://r2vq.org/) for more information.
### Semantic Visualization of Scientific Data
I am working on the exploration of the Covid-19 literature through semantic visualization. Check out
our [SemViz](https://www.semviz.org/) web page for the latest work!
