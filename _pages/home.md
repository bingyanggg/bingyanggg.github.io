### About
I am a first year PhD student in Natural Language Processing supervised by [Prof. James Pustejovsky](https://jamespusto.com/) at Brandeis University. Before, I worked as a NLP Scientist at CodaMetrix with a focus in Clinical NLP.

My research interests include Natural Language Understanding, Computational Linguistics, Language Annotation, Clinical NLP and ML/DL in general.

<!-- ## Activities
---
### Designing Multimodal Datasets for NLP Challenges
I am working on building R2VQ, a dataset designed for testing competence-based comprehension of machines over a multimodal recipe collection.
Check out [here](https://r2vq.org/) for more information.
### Semantic Visualization of Scientific Data
I am working on the exploration of the Covid-19 literature through semantic visualization. Check out
our [SemViz](https://www.semviz.org/) web page for the latest work!
